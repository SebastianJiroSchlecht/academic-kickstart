abstract = {Comb filters composed in a parallel or a serial way are a popular part of delay-line based artificial reverberators. Because the analysis of a complex comb filter structure can be tedious, there is a need for transforming such a structure into a compact and general representation. For this a transformation into the feedback delay network (FDN) filter structure is proposed as it is a general and well established framework to investigate the acoustic properties of the filter and therefore allows to compare different approaches.

abstract = {In reverberation enhancement systems (RESs), sound is constantly fed back from multiple microphones to multiple loudspeakers to enhance reverberation artificially in the target room. This contribution shows that such a system can be understood as an extended feedback delay network (FDN). A tuning process, similar to that of the FDN is presented, allowing arbitrary frequency-dependent reverberation elongation. The cross-talk between the loudspeakers and the microphones leads to comb filtering and isolated ringing modes in the RES, which produce undesired metallic and rough sounds. To mitigate these undesired effects, a cross-talk cancellation system is integrated in the RES. In a simulation example, the benefits of cross-talk cancellation is evaluated.},

abstract = {Feedback delay networks (FDNs) can be efficiently used to generate parametric artificial reverberation. Recently, the authors proposed a novel approach to time-varying FDNs by introducing a time-varying feedback matrix. The formulation of the time-varying feedback matrix was given in the complex eigenvalue domain, whereas this contribution specifies the requirements for real valued time-domain processing. In addition, the computational costs of different time-varying feedback matrices, which depend on the matrix type and modulation function, are discussed. In a performance evaluation, the proposed orthogonal matrix modulation is compared to a direct interpolation of the matrix entries.},

abstract = {This paper presents a technique to increase the stability of a reverberation enhancement system (RES) via time-variation. RESs are installed in rooms to extend the physical reverberation time via electroacoustic feedback. By introducing variations in the feedback path, the probability that energy builds-up is reduced, and therefore the gain before instability is increased. Time-varying mixing of the feedback paths by unitary matrices is guaranteed to be energy-conserving and introduces variations of the added reverberation generated by a feedback delay network. The theory of time-varying matrices is reviewed and a practical demonstration is given.},

abstract = {Various time-varying algorithms have been applied in multichannel sound systems to improve the system{\textquoteright}s stability and, among these, frequency shifting has been demonstrated to reach the maximum stability improvement achievable by time-variation in general. However, the modulation artifacts have been found to diminish the gain improvement unusable for a higher number of channels and high-quality applications such as music reproduction. This paper proposes alternatively time-varying mixing matrices, which is an efficient algorithm corresponding to symmetric up and down frequency shifting. It is shown with a statistical approach that time-varying mixing matrices can as well achieve maximum stability improvement for a higher number of channels. A listening test demonstrates the improved quality of time-varying mixing matrices over frequency shifting.},

abstract = {Feedback delay networks (FDNs) are frequently used to generate artificial reverberation. This contribution discusses the temporal features of impulse responses produced by FDNs, i.e., the number of echoes per time unit and its evolution over time. This so-called echo density is related to known measures of mixing time and their psychoacoustic correlates such as auditive perception of the room size. It is shown that the echo density of FDNs follows a polynomial function, whereby the polynomial coefficients can be derived from the lengths of the delays for which an explicit method is given. The mixing time of impulse responses can be predicted from the echo density, and conversely, a desired mixing time can be achieved by a derived mean delay length. A Monte Carlo simulation confirms the accuracy of the derived relation of mixing time and delay lengths.},

abstract = {Lossless Feedback Delay Networks (FDNs) are commonly used as a design prototype for artificial reverberation algorithms. The lossless property is dependent on the feedback matrix, which connects the output of a set of delays to their inputs, and the lengths of the delays. Both, unitary and triangular feedback matrices are known to constitute lossless FDNs, however, the most general class of lossless feedback matrices has not been identified. In this contribution, it is shown that the FDN is lossless for any set of delays, if all irreducible components of the feedback matrix are diagonally similar to a unitary matrix. The necessity of the generalized class of feedback matrices is demonstrated by examples of FDN designs proposed in literature.},

abstract = {The reverberation time is one of the most prominent acoustical qualities of a physical room. Therefore, it is crucial that artificial reverberation algorithms match a specified target reverberation time accurately. In feedback delay networks, a popular framework for modeling room acoustics, the reverberation time is determined by combining delay and attenuation filters such that the frequency-dependent attenuation response is proportional to the delay length and by this complying to a global attenuation-per-second. However, only few details are available on the attenuation filter design as the approximation errors of the filter design are often regarded negligible. In this work, we demonstrate that the error of the filter approximation propagates in a non-linear fashion to the resulting reverberation time possibly causing large deviation from the specified target. For the special case of a proportional graphic equalizer, we propose a non-linear least squares solution and demonstrate the improved accuracy with a Monte Carlo simulation.},

Participants physically walk to sound objects in a virtual reality created by a head-mounted display and binaural audio. The method allows for comparative evaluation of different rendering and tracking systems. We show how the localization accuracy of spatial audio rendering is reflected by objective measures of the participants{\textquoteright} behavior and task performance. As independent variables we add tracking latency or reduce the binaural cues. We provide a reference scenario with loudspeaker reproduction and an anchor scenario with monaural reproduction for comparison.},

abstract = {In today{\textquoteright}s audio production and reproduction as well as in music performance practices it has become common practice to alter reverberation artificially through electronics or electro- acoustics. For music productions, radio plays, and movie soundtracks, the sound is often captured in small studio spaces with little to no reverberation to save real estate and to ensure a controlled environment such that the artistically intended spatial impression can be added during post-production. Spatial sound reproduction systems require flexible adjustment of artificial reverberation to the diffuse sound portion to help the reconstruction of the spatial impression. Many modern performance spaces are multi-purpose, and the reverberation needs to be adjustable to the desired performance style. Employing electro-acoustic feedback, also known as Reverberation Enhancement Systems (RESs), it is possible to extend the physical to the desired reverberation.These examples demonstrate a wide range of applications where reverberation is created and enhanced artificially employing signal processing techniques. A major challenge of designing artificial reverberators is the high complexity of the physical reverberation process. Even small office spaces of 40 m3 exhibit more than 107 acoustic modes, in concert halls the number of acoustic modes can surpass 109 in the audible range. The room geometry, as well as the interaction with the boundary materials, can be as well fairly complex. Whereas these complex considerations are mandatory for simulations of specific spaces, used for example for the acoustic and architectural planning of a concert venue, they are somewhat misleading in the realm of artistic applications. The focus on perceptually convincing artificial reverberation algorithms provides the freedom to make some simplifications to the generation process, leading to the recursive systems, which play a central role in this dissertation.},

abstract = {Decorrelation of audio signals is a critical step for spatial sound reproduction on multichannel configurations. Correlated signals yield a focused phantom source between the reproduction loudspeakers and may produce undesirable comb-filtering artifacts when the signal reaches the listener with small phase differences. Decorrelation techniques reduce such artifacts and extend the spatial auditory image by randomizing the phase of a signal while minimizing the spectral coloration. This paper proposes a method to optimize the decorrelation properties of a sparse noise sequence, called velvet noise, to generate short sparse FIR decorrelation filters. The sparsity allows a highly efficient time-domain convolution. The listening test results demonstrate that the proposed optimization method can yield effective and colorless decorrelation filters. In comparison to a white noise sequence, the filters obtained using the proposed method preserve better the spectrum of a signal and produce good quality broadband decorrelation while using 76% fewer operations for the convolution. Satisfactory results can be achieved with an even lower impulse density which decreases the computational cost by 88%. This paper received the [2nd Best Paper Award](http://dafx2018.web.ua.pt/).},

abstract = {Feedback delay networks (FDNs) are an efficient tool for creating artificial reverberation. Recently, various designs for spatially extending the FDN were proposed. A central topic in the design of spatial FDNs is the choice of the feedback matrix that governs the interaction between spatially distributed elements and therefore the spatial impression. In the design prototype, the feedback matrix is chosen to be unilossless such that the reverberation time is infinite. However, in physics- and aesthetics-driven design of spatial FDNs, the target feedback matrix is not necessarily unilossless. This contribution proposes an optimization method for finding a close unilossless feedback matrix and improves the accuracy by relaxing the specification of the target matrix phase component and focussing on the sign-agnostic component.},

This paper adapts classic multiple stimulus test methodology to virtual reality and adds behavioral tracking functionality.

The proposed evaluation method allows immersion in multimodal virtual scenes while enabling comparative evaluation of multiple binaural renderers. A pilot study is conducted to evaluate feasibility of the proposed method and to identify challenges in virtual reality audio quality evaluation. Finally, the results are compared to a non-immersive off-line evaluation method.},

However, virtual reality (VR) systems allow the listener to move in six-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF), i.e., three rotational plus three transitional degrees of freedom. Here, the apparent angles and distances of the sound sources depend on the listener{\textquoteright}s position. We propose a technique to facilitate 6DoF. In particular, a FOA recording is described using a parametric model, which is modified based on the listener{\textquoteright}s position and information about the distances to the sources. We evaluate our method by a listening test, comparing different binaural renderings of a synthetic sound scene in which the listener can move freely.},

The study at hand focuses on a scenario where the angle is induced by listener self-translation in relation to a stationary sound source. First, the classic stationary listener minimum audible angle experiment is replicated using a headphone-based reproduction system. This experiment confirms that the reproduction system is able to produce a localization cue resolution comparable to loudspeaker reproduction. Next, the self-translation minimum audible angle is shown to be 3.3{\textdegree} in the horizontal plane in front of the listener.},
