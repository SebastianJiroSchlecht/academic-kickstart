# Biography

Sebastian J. Schlecht is a postdoctoral researcher at the International Audio Laboratories Erlangen of the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. His research interests include spatial audio processing with an emphasis on artificial reverberation, localization, and panning, 6- degree-of-freedom virtual and mixed reality applications. In particular, his research efforts have been directed towards the intersection of mathematical filter design, efficient algorithms, perceptual aspects, and user-oriented experience. Sebastian Schlecht complements his scientific work with being an avid musical performer, and a research and development consultant at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits (IIS) in Erlangen.
