abstract = "Feedback delay networks (FDNs) are an efficient tool for creating artificial reverberation. Recently, various designs for spatially extending the FDN were proposed. A central topic in the design of spatial FDNs is the choice of the feedback matrix that governs the interaction between spatially distributed elements and therefore the spatial impression. In the design prototype, the feedback matrix is chosen to be unilossless such that the reverberation time is infinite. However, in physics- and aesthetics-driven design of spatial FDNs, the target feedback matrix is not necessarily unilossless. This contribution proposes an optimization method for finding a close unilossless feedback matrix and improves the accuracy by relaxing the specification of the target matrix phase component and focussing on the sign-agnostic component."
