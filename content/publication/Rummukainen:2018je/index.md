abstract = "The minimum audible angle has been studied with a stationary listener and a stationary or a moving sound source. The study at hand focuses on a scenario where the angle is induced by listener self-translation in relation to a stationary sound source. First, the classic stationary listener minimum audible angle experiment is replicated using a headphone-based reproduction system. This experiment confirms that the reproduction system is able to produce a localization cue resolution comparable to loudspeaker reproduction. Next, the self-translation minimum audible angle is shown to be 3.3 degree in the horizontal plane in front of the listener."
